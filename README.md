# Telecommunications-Project

## Objective
The purpose of this project is to analyze call records from the virtual telephony service CallMeMaybe in order to identify performance patterns among operators, detect those considered ineffective based on key metrics (missed calls, waiting times, and outbound call volume), and statistically validate the observed differences.

The goal is to generate reliable and actionable insights that allow supervisors to improve team management and optimize service quality.
